### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

-   Create a fictional product generated by AI (MidJourney) that is sold on an e-comm platform.
-   Develop a Frontend & Backend solution

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

5 Week Project

### :dart: Goals:

-   [x] Develop knowledge of `JS`
-   [x] Experience with web development workflows and build tools `NVM`, `NPM`
-   [x] Experience with `responsive design` & `mobile web development`
-   [x] Experience with various deployment platforms `Vercel`, `Heroku`
-   [x] Experiment with techniques of animation on the web `Framer-Motion`
-   [x] Being comfortable with Git, and Git workflows
-   [x] Familiar with modern JS frameworks `Next.js` and have the ability to learn/adapt to new technologies.
-   [x] Awareness of performance bottlenecks and cross-browser issues `Lighthouse` `Chrome Dev Tools`
-   [ ] An understanding of common JavaScript design patterns
-   [x] Fullstack experience, `GraphQL`, `Auth0`, `Stripe` and experience with headless CMS products `Strapi`.
-   [ ] Develop with Typescript
-   [ ] Use TDD

### :mechanical_arm: Solution:

We wanted to optimise time spent on the Frontend, so we used `Strapi` as a headless CMS. We chose `Next.js` as our framework as we wanted to boost learnings in this area.

### :man_student: Learnings:

By in large we successfully hit most of our goals. If we were to redo the project, taking time to apply TDD and use Typescript would have been beneficial.

### :interrobang: Future Improvements & Current Bugs:

-   Generate 3D renders of the product. This would have improved the professionalism of the e-comm store. However, we felt this was outside of the scope of the project and didnâ€™t have 3D render skills within the team.
-   Add a Dark/Light mode
-   If we had more time tidying up the animation of the Hero Slider which switches between videos awkwardly.
